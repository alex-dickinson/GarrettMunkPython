`GarrettMunkPython` is a `Python` toolbox for computing Garrett-Munk (`GM`) spectra that model the oceanic internal wave field.

Other toolboxes on `GitHub` for computing `GM` spectra:

* [GarrettMunkMatlab](https://github.com/jklymak/GarrettMunkMatlab): A MATLAB toolbox for computing horizontal and vertical forms of the `GM` spectra. `GarrettMunkPython` is partially based on this toolbox
* [GM81](https://github.com/joernc/GM81): A `Python` package for computing only the `GM81` version of the spectrum. (In GarrettMunkPython, `GM81` is referred to as `GM76`)
* [GLOceanKit](https://github.com/Energy-Pathways-Group/GLOceanKit): A collection of models and analysis tools for physical oceanography, including tools for computing the Garrett-Munk spectrum and its approximations. Written in `MATLAB`
